# Kitchen Dashboard v1.0.6 - Subscription-Based Model

## Overview

Kitchen Dashboard v1.0.6 is now configured as a **subscription-based application** where only users with accounts created by the administrator in Firebase can access the application. This ensures controlled access and proper data isolation for each subscriber.

## Subscription Model Features

### 🔐 Admin-Managed Authentication
- **Only pre-created users can access**: Users must have accounts created by you in Firebase Authentication
- **Email/Password authentication**: Subscribers login with their assigned credentials
- **No self-registration**: Users cannot create their own accounts
- **Controlled access**: You control who can use the application

### 👤 User Data Isolation
- **Individual user data**: Each subscriber's data is stored separately in Firebase
- **User-specific collections**: Data is organized under `/users/{userId}/` in Firestore
- **No data mixing**: Users can only access their own data
- **Secure separation**: Complete isolation between different subscribers

### ☁️ Cloud Sync for Subscribers
- **Real-time synchronization**: All subscriber data syncs to your Firebase project
- **Automatic backups**: Data is automatically backed up to the cloud
- **Cross-device access**: Subscribers can access their data from multiple devices
- **Conflict resolution**: Built-in handling for data conflicts

### 🚫 No Offline Mode
- **Online-only operation**: Application requires internet connection
- **Authentication required**: Users must be logged in to use the app
- **Session management**: Automatic logout after inactivity
- **Connection monitoring**: App exits if connection is lost

## How It Works

### For You (Administrator):
1. **Create user accounts** in Firebase Authentication console
2. **Assign email/password** to each subscriber
3. **Monitor usage** through Firebase console
4. **Manage subscriptions** by enabling/disabling accounts
5. **Access all data** through Firebase admin interface

### For Subscribers:
1. **Receive credentials** from you (email/password)
2. **Login to application** with provided credentials
3. **Use Kitchen Dashboard** with full functionality
4. **Data automatically syncs** to cloud
5. **Access from any device** with same credentials
