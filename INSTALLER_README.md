#define MyAppVersion "1.0.5"
#define MyAppPublisher "VARSYS Technologies"
```

#### Installation Paths
```pascal
DefaultDirName={autopf}\{#MyAppName}
DefaultGroupName={#MyAppName}
```

#### Additional Files
Add new files in the `[Files]` section:
```pascal
Source: "path\to\new\file"; DestDir: "{app}"; Flags: ignoreversion
```

#### Registry Entries
Add custom registry entries in the `[Registry]` section:
```pascal
Root: HKCU; Subkey: "SOFTWARE\MyApp"; ValueType: string; ValueName: "Setting"; ValueData: "Value"
```

### Build Script Paths

If Inno Setup is installed in a different location, update the path in the build scripts:

**build_installer.bat:**
```batch
set "INNO_SETUP_PATH=C:\Your\Custom\Path\ISCC.exe"
```

**build_installer.ps1:**
```powershell
$InnoSetupPath = "C:\Your\Custom\Path\ISCC.exe"
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Inno Setup not found"
- Install Inno Setup 6 from the official website
- Update the path in build scripts if installed elsewhere

#### "Build directory not found"
- Run `python setup_fixed.py build` first
- Ensure the build completed successfully

#### "Main executable not found"
- Check that `build/exe.win-amd64-3.13/VARSYS_Kitchen_Dashboard.exe` exists
- Verify the cx_Freeze build didn't have errors

#### "Access denied" during build
- Run the build script as Administrator
- Check that the output directory is writable

### Build Verification

After building, verify the installer:
1. **Size Check** - Should be 200-300 MB
2. **Test Installation** - Install on a clean system
3. **Functionality Test** - Ensure the app runs correctly
4. **Uninstall Test** - Verify clean removal

## üì¶ Distribution

### Installer Properties
- **Digitally Signed** - Consider code signing for production
- **Virus Scanning** - Scan with antivirus before distribution
- **Compression** - Uses LZMA compression for smaller size
- **64-bit Only** - Requires 64-bit Windows 10 or later

### Deployment Options
- **Direct Download** - Host on website or file sharing
- **Package Managers** - Consider Chocolatey or Winget
